s) queue : FIFO (first-in first-out

ex)
stack.push(10)
[10]
stack.push(3)
[10, 3]

stack.pop()
[10]

if) stack js empty, popping returns nil or error message.

beginning of an array is expensive, an O(n)
  because it requires all existing array elements to be shifted in memory.
Adding at the end is O(1);
