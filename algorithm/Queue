* FIFO (first-in first-out)
: The element you inserted first is the first one to come out.
s) stack : LIFO (last-in first-out)

ex)
queue.enqueue(10)
[ 10 ]

queue.enqueue(3)
[ 10, 3 ]

queue.enqueue(15)
[ 10, 3, 15 ]

queue.dequeue()
[ 3, 15 ]

queue.dequeue()
[ 15 ]

N) A Queue is not always the best choice.
   If the order in which the items are added and removed from the list is not important, you can use a stack instead of a queue.
   Stacks are simpler and faster.
